<h2>Updates to Add</h2>

Here're some of the updates that I am planning to add :

*   Auto completion and suggestions 
*   Multi Rooms So that one can share code and multiple persons can work on the same code live using sockets.
*   Improve process management so that it can handle a large number of requests at a time.
